argtable2 (2.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Release. (closes: #306755)
  * Added an SONAME to the library
  * Changed name from libargtable2.so.x (where x is the version, x=4 for 2.4)
    to libargtable2.so.0. This was done to make sure things don't break as a
    result of the addition of SONAME to the library, and with some
    coordination with upstream (who does not want to add SONAME there at this
    point).
